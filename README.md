# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This project aimed to develop a robust predictive model for loan default prediction, leveraging machine learning techniques to improve financial decision-making processes. The primary goal was to identify key risk factors associated with loan default and to build a model that could accurately predict default probabilities for new applicants.
Through an extensive evaluation of various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Gradient Boosting, the Random Forest model emerged as the most effective. After hyperparameter tuning, the Random Forest model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 99%, with macro and weighted average F1-scores also at 99%, indicating excellent model performance. The model's AUC score of 0.99 further validated its predictive power.
Key deliverables from this project include the optimized Random Forest model, which was rigorously tested and validated. Additionally, explainable AI techniques such as feature importance, Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs), Permutation importance and Local Interpretable Mode-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) were employed to provide transparency into how specific features influenced the model's predictions. Additionally, the project involved the development of a comprehensive website that showcases the model's predictions and allows users to interact with the loan default prediction system in a user-friendly manner also Loan default dashboard I was developed using Power BI for customers and financial institutions to get insights on the major contributors of loan default.
The practical impact of this project is significant, as it offers a powerful tool for banks and lending institutions to assess the likelihood of loan defaults more accurately. By implementing this predictive model, lenders can mitigate risks, tailor loan products to individual borrowers' profiles, and enhance the overall efficiency of the lending process.
